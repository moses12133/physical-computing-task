### what is physical computing?
Physical computing means building interactive physical systems by the use of software and hardware that can sense and respond to the analog world.

# DIFFERENT TYPES OF MICROCONTROLLERS: 
##### It is a compact and small sized integrated circuit that governs a specific operation in the embedded system Here is a list of the different types of microcontrollers

# DIFFERENT TYPES OF SENSORS:
#####  A sensor refers to a device that detects or measures a physical property that is analysed in some sort of fashion, examples of sensors is that it is used to read any movement which is then trasported to the device.

# THE DIFFERENT BETWEEN ANALOG AND DIGITAL SIGNALS:
The difference between analog and digial is that, analog signal is a continuous signal which represents physical measurements.A digital signals are discrete time signals generated by digital modulation.
# FANTACY DEVICE
## FORTNIE GLASSES/HEADPHONES:
These fortnite glasses will make it easy and portable for you to play fortnite without you needing any kind of controller. These look like ordinary glasses.... BUT they arn't. When you tilt these headphones, they reveal a screen which you can play fortnite on. These glasses reconise the movement of your eyes and makes your character in the game move. To do things such as shoot, all you need to do is close one eye. Other movements in the game are all controlled with your facial expressions.
