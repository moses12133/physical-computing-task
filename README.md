### what is physical computing?
Physical computing means building interactive physical systems by the use of software and hardware that can sense and respond to the analog world.

# THE DIFFERENT BETWEEN ANALOG AND DIGITAL SIGNALS:
The difference between analog and digial is that, analog signal is a continuous signal which represents physical measurements.A digital signals are discrete time signals generated by digital modulation.
